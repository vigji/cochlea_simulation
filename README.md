## Simulation of the cochlea mechanics
Code accompaining a presentation on the mechanics of the inner ear (chapter 20 of 
[Mathematical physiology](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387758466) by J. Keener and J. Sneyd).

It contains a PDE model that describes the behavior of the basilar membrane when compression waves produced by sound travel 
in the cochlea.
The model is implemented in MATLAB.
